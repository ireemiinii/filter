### 1.Filter
I applied filter 1 to both image. The first filter has a value of 1 in the upper right corner, so the image 
makes a shift to the left in the diagonal. 

### 2.Filter
I applied filter 2 to both image. Our middle value for filter 2 is 1.5 times the value of the pixels above the 
image. Increases the brightness of pixels. (I made the middle value 3 to see more clearly and I 
understood better)

### 3.Filter
I applied filter 3 to both image. 3. The filter makes the edges look sharp. I think there is a filter used for 
determining the edge on the image.
